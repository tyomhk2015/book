# Day 9

From chapter 39 to 45(The final chapter).



### Chapter 39

<b><i>AI? ML? DL?</i></b>

> AI

Articifical Intelligence. There are two type of AI.

1. Narrow AI / Weak AI

The AI focuses on, specialized in one task. This is the current stage of today's AI.

2. General AI / Strong AI

The AI that behaves like a real human. This is TO-BE of the AI.

> ML

Machine learning, a method of teaching or educating AI, enabling them to do a certain task by itself.

There are two kinds of learnings.

1. Supervised learning

Giving AI labels(features) of a specimen, and AI will receive numerous specimens from the supervisor, the human. After AI learned many specimens, it will start to distinguish or judge with the data it has learned from.

```
  "On the top of my data, labels of this food picture are about 66% positive and I will determine that this food is 'pancake'. 
```

With wrong data given, the AI will do wrong judgements.

2. Unsupervised learning

Gives many samples of data to AI until the AI finally becomes to judge by itself. A lot of computation and data are process during the learning session.

> DL

Deep learning, one of many methods of teaching AI, a subset of ML. The name is deep learning because there are many layers, like a tall building with many floors, for processing learning.

To have a little of taste of ML, Tensor-flow may be a good option, since it can be worked with C++, Go, Python etc.

### Chapter 40

<b><i>REST API?</i></b>

Representational state transfer.

Before the REST API, the APIs were written with verbs and nouns.

```
  e.g.)
  
```
