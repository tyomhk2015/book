# Day 3

From chapter 11 to 15.



### Chapter 11

<b><i>Distinguishing between `Library` and `Framework`</i></b>

If the developer has the control over where to call APIs or put codes, and switching from one type of APIs to another is easy, then it would be a `library`.

On contrast, if the developer has no control over calling APIs or putting codes freely, and cost of switching from one type constraint to another type of constraint is expensive, it would be a `framework`.

For instance, Vue.js and React.js are introduced as `libraries`, but when it comes to designing and utilizing components, they become very similar to `frameworks`.
Some rules have to be obeyed in order to see a page composed by components.

This chapter did give me a clear standard for comparing `libraries` and `frameworks`.


### Chapter 12

<b><i>Is learning `jQuery` mandatory?</i></b>

My answer to this is `no`.

I have used `jQuery` due to the legacy environment that is used in one of biggest Japanese company. Compare to writing in vanilla JS, `jQuery` do help developers reducing the time for writing codes.

Many developers do assert that jQuery is dead, there is no future in jQuery. However, they are still used by many companies that makes huge amount of profit. I believe using `jQuery` is not like sin or a bad choice, but there are better chances for those who learn other frameworks, like `React.js`.


### Chapter 13

<b><i>The meaning of `API`.</i></b>


Application Protocol Interface.

Just think this as a `server` in a restaurant that takes order from you to do somethings else for you.

API does not only apply to server APIs, but also libraries or WEB APIs like, `map()`. You don't need to write from very beginnning with for-loops for implementing a feature that iterates an array. You can ask the server to do the iteration for you by telling the server with `map()` command.

Thanks to APIs, the speed and development of programming got swifter than in 1980s.

### Chapter 14

<b><i>The reasons for paying money for buying domains.</i></b>

It is more simple to say that providers of domains are just like big database, that is being maintained and taking cared.

The immense amount of work to be done to provide fast and secured database is no easy job. I cannot image all the needs to be satisfied in order to provide a domain for myself. Ofcourse, if you are very talented and knows all the requirements and practices for creating and servings domains, a great fortune may come true.

Last year I bought a domain from Vercel, for my side project, it cost only 20$ per year. The registry was `.net`, which was a simple one, but the price was way cheaper than I imagined.


### Chapter 15

<i>The end of `flash` and Steve Jobs.</i>

Ah, preventing potential threat of monopoly of web tech. What kind of world would I be living in if the `flash` was taking intangible power over whole web tech?

This is something new to me, and now, I grasped an idea of the background story of `flash`'s disappearance.
