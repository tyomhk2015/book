1. Improve CS knowledge

Will try to do it on days where context switching happens less, weekend, and spend arount three to four hours. Notes during the CS study will be stored in Github.

2. Take coding tests

To make my brain active, I'll try to solve two or more coding problems per week.

3. Double the income

Yes, I am planning to take two projects at once. Whenever there is a chance, I'll apply to new projects. 

4. Deepen React & Next.js skill

To finish tasks faster, I'll not only take a look at documentations but also the react library code, and other blogs written by experts. This will be done on weekdays.

5. Build up muscles

Health is money. To prevent from brain fog, I'll do squats with 10KG dumbbells on each hand, 20 reps 5sets. This will be done once every two days.
