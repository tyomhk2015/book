# Day 2

From chapter 6 to 10.



### Chapter 6

<i>About the mind sets and practices when dealing with errors.</i>

`Errors` are treated as something the developers have avoid, but is it?

I believe that the errors gives the developers chance to improve their programming skill, and technical problem solving skill. The more you face the errors, the more you know about the lacking areas while programming.

While solving the errors, there is high chance of learning new technical terms, concepts, or business logic of dependencies.

I do encounter many errors while developing web services, espcially when setting environment for development. In Japan, there are many SaaSs using `Ruby on Rails` as backend, and I have faced many errors related to the environment settings. Many of the errors were either about `ruby` version compatibility with other dependencies, or missing `curl` links of dependencies.

The first time I saw the errors related to the enviroment setting, I did not have any clue what was going on. However, by tracking the error logs, I searched about the errors and tried solutions suggested by many other developers. 

One by one, the number for the error logs got resolved, and at the end, the environment setting could've become a success. Ofcourse, it did take sometime, about two days.

This habit of resolving errors is one of my skills that I am very proud of. It is like being a detective and tracking the source of the problem.



### Chapter 7

<i>Elaborates on the popularity of `Python`</i>

Never used python yet, and thanks to the book I have gained brief knowledge about it.

According to the book, `Python` became popular due to the following facts.

```
  1. The language is similar to English.
```

This could be comphrehended as the syntax, names of default APIs provided by `Python` is easy to be understood without getting into details.


```
  2. Could be leveraged to many fields.
```

Fields that use `Python` are AI, data science, web development, automation, image, games etc.

With only one language, there are many choices to choose from.

```
  3. The size of `Python` community is huge.
```

This means that you can get some help easily when working with the language.

I'm hoping to take some project that uses `Python` in 2023.



### Chapter 8

<i>Explains why `Python` is slower than `C`</i>

```
  Interprete & Compile
```

`Interprete` is close to translating one language into another language in realtime.

`Compile` is translating and leaving documentation or book as its byproduct.

There is no doubt that the performance is important in software development. However, if performance was the only factor or standard to evaluate the value of softwares, then assembly language should have been the prime programming language.

I believe the reason behind the creation of new languages is `efficiency of time`. Yes, you can make almost anything you want with assembly code, but the code base will become very large, and hard to maintain or read. Not only that, the time you have to invest to make the desired software will be immense. This could be applied to `Python` and `C`.

Frankly speaking, to utilize the time wisely, to be more productive, to manage sources more conveniently could be the main reasons why people want to use `Python` over `C`.

### Chapter 9

<i>About if Javascript limited only to web developments.</i>

Like `Python`, `Javascript` could be utilized in other fields such as machine learning, mobile applications, desktop applications, 3D, AR etc.

This credit goes to node.js which enables the javascript to be used other than just browsers. The creator of node.js is `Ryan Dahl`.


### Chapter 10

<i>`Kotlin` is compatible with `Java`</i>

Never thought of transcompiling `Kotlin` application into `Javascript`. Until now, I thought `Kotlin` was purely for replacing Java applications, or building Android applications.

Have I had to build an Android application, `Kotlin` is the choice for me, because I do have some experience with Java.
