# Day 1

From chapter 1 to 5.

### Chapter 1

<b><i>Deals with some misconceptions about being a 'developer'.</i></b>

```
Misconception No.1: 
Being a deveoper is easy and anyone can do it.
```

Have seen many people trying to become a web developer, but some of them quit during the training.

Even though they, somehow, get the web developing job, some of them do quit in a couple of years.

Never have asked them about the reasons for quitting the web developer, because it is their life.

By observing the number of people who do quit being developer, either during bootcamps or in a real job, I cannot agree more with the assertion that being a developer is not for everyone.


```
Misconception No.5: 
All developers must be outstanding in math.
```

The misconcept may be true depending on which field of software developer you are aiming at.

Lets say there is a kid who want to create a 2D or 3D game. It depends on what kind of game that kid wants to make, but there is high chance of leveraging mathematical skill when implementing movement, gravity, engine, lighting etc.

In other cases, when you have to optimize a product that is already being served to world wide. For instance, optimzing read time or response time for clients request in a web service.

For web developers math may be like an ornament, something that is good to have but not necessary. However, I do highly recommend to have some knowledge of Math which is handy when dealing with performance improvement tasks.


### Chapter 2

<b><i>Elaborates on topic about the first language to learn.</i></b>

Priortizing or clarifiying the thing you want make with programming could help you with choosing the language choice. Perhaps observing the supply and demands of programming market may help you to become wiser when choosing a language.

If you are aiming for `3D` games, specifically the ones that could be made using Unity engine, `C#` could be one of candidates.

Trying to become a `web` developer, then `Javascript` is mandatory.

Be clear about what you need, what you want todo, and research about the availabe options you can choose from. I believe two weeks is sufficient for the research. Don't need to go deep, unless you are curious about it.


### Chapter 3

<b><i>Explains about learning a new language.</i></b>

There is no better way to learn a new language other than making small applications with it. You will more familiar  with the syntax, usage, and effciency of using the new language will get better. Ideal is making a personal project that could be monetized.

Not sure about features that the language provide? The official documentation could be your friend or a resolver. However, in some cases, having a glance at the source code with texteditor or IDE could be handy, because there might be some information that are not posted at the official document.

### Chapter 4

<b><i>Tells history or background of the name of languages.</i></b>

Though the people who made the programming languages are genius and enginneers, their sense of naming is just like an ordinary person, human nature. Thinking about things that are around them, things they do like personally.


### Chapter 5

<b><i>Elaborates on topic about languages that have similar names, `C`, `C++`, and `C#`.</i></b>

The relation of `C` and `C++` is like `Javascript` and `Typescript`, supersets.
I've learned that `C#` is developed and invested by Microsoft for their needs, window applications. The book taught me that the syntax of `C#` is similar to `Java`, and the next project I am about to participate at beginning of Feburary, it is using C# .NET as backend. The book releived my anxiety and fear of C# and looking forward to participate the next project.
