# Day 5

From chapter 22 to 25.



### Chapter 22

<b><i>Data structures and algorithms are essential?</i></b>

Depending on what area you are working at in IT industry and what role you are taking on, the chance of using the knowledge of data structures and algorithms will vary.

If you are making a game or SaaS tool, or tuning the performance of exisiting products or services, data structures and algorithms may help you to achieve performance improvement.

In web development, there are many tools or libraries that does complicated features for you, but when you have to deal with a lot of data and you need to find an efficient to manage those, that is where the data structure and algorithms comes in.

I consider it is better to find practical use case for every algorithms or data structures you come up to, which may be in your memory much longer than just studying them.


### Chapter 23

<b><i>What is the `array`?</i></b>

A space, that has equivalent size, to store something. The space can be more than one section.

Similar to apartment, or mansion in Japan, where there number of same looking rooms in a building.

Sometimes an address of some data is stored in array, pratical example of this is `index`.


### Chapter 24

<b><i>Expressing the performance of algorithms</i></b>

Big O Notation is a mean of expressing the performance or efficiency of a specific algorithm.

On the top of my head, the Omega symbol of Big O Notation refers to the worst case, or the longest time the algorithm took to finish its job.

### Chapter 25

<b><i>What is search algorithm?</i></b>

Search algorithm means a procedure to find data from an array.

Binary search algorithm. I do like its performance, but if the given array is not sorted in an order, extra task of sorting the array must be done before using the binary search. If this is the case, then would the `N^2 + Nlog(N)`?

The size of the array must be considered when choosing the algorithm to solve given task.
